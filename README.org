Musings on software development

** TODO foto
   There has to be a foto and a nice way to place it. It must be on the CV page and added as a footer on each blog post.

** TODO category tag
   There shall be a document attribute ~garykl-categories~ and a
   script that reads those. A specific ~docinfo-header.html~ is
   created for each document that shows all categories.
   
** TODO category page
   For each category found in the previous script, an adoc file is
   created that contains links to the articles that contain the
   category. The ~docinfo-header.html~ shall contain links, instead of
   just text.
