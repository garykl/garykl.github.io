<p>My name is Gary Klindt, and I work at <a href="https://www.ptvgroup.com">PTV Group</a>, currently as a <strong>Cloud System Architect</strong>. You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gary-klindt-ptv/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>I do a lot of <strong>talking to people</strong>, a <strong>bit on business</strong>, and a lot on technical stuff. I preserve my technical skills by 'doing' technical things as well. I&#8217;ve been a passionate software engineer for about six years, working on the <strong>backend with dotnet</strong>, mainly. My focus has been on domain design and service communication.</p>

<p>As a physicist, I did <strong>computer simulations</strong> on density functional theory on atomic gold structures and hydrodynamics of biological microswimmers as well as <strong>data extraction</strong> from videos made from biological experiments.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;ve always been a <strong>programming language lover</strong>, from a practical point of view, so I tried to learn a set of languages as diverse as useful. So Brainfuck is not a language of my interest, but many, many others.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m writing, since I like to <strong>reflect on my learnings</strong>. As an architect, I&#8217;m exposed to a variety of topics, and I&#8217;m looking forward to draw connections between topics from my past with current topics.</p>
